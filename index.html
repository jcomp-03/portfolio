<!--
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

                    Again, welcome to my website! I started coding only in December 2021, when I enrolled in a coding bootcamp. So, this page
                    from which you are reading this text is a proverbial <em>work-in-progress</em>. I decided to enroll in this boot camp for a lot of
                    reasons, but in a nutshell, I wanted to try something new for my profession.
                    <br><br>
                    For a little background on who I am, I was born in Ireland, raised in Miami, Florida, and have lived in a number of different
                    cities since moving away from home after high school. Those cities are New York, Atlanta, Albuquerque, Portland, and Lima (Peru, that is!).
                    I have had great experiences living in those cities, each of which taught me valuable nuggets of wisdom and helped me form my world perspective.
                    If I had to choose which city I look back on most fondly, I think I would select Portland; the Pacific Northwest is absolutely stunning
                    and offers a balanced city-and-outdoors lifestyle.
