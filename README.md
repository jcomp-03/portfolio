# Week 2 Challenge - Professional Portfolio

The purpose of this week's challenge is to create a portfolio page including CSS styling which shows a responsive design when the page is viewed from different screens.

A template was provided so that I could use it in designing the portfolio page from scratch.

This README file will be amended when the challenge is resubmitted for grading, as the mobile response (i.e. media queries) features are not fully built out yet.
